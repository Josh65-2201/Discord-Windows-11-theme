## Functionality changes
Some controls have moved to conform with Windows 11 styles.


### Moved settings
- Toast/Notifications now have an global toggle in the themes settings
- Mute and deafen settings are now shown only on the voice connected panel
- Stickers and GIFs are now all in the emote menu
- Search bars are on the title bar
- User profile is now in the title bar next to window controls


### Other
- User/Members list will now auto hide at smallest window size. (Toggle doesn't do anything visibly at min size but will save state upon resize)
- Due to layering issues the Window drag area is small bar at top of the window

<br></br>

## Development
### Guidelines
- Any editor will work, Visual Studios Code is recommended.
- Indents use tabs at 4 spaces.
- New sections follow the line gaps
```
Main section 1 (E.G. Servers bar, Messages content)
	Sub section 1 (E.G. Server icon, Message)
		Part 1 (Position, Background color)
		Part 2 (Position, Background color)

	Sub section 2 (E.G. Server icon, Message)


Main section 2 (E.G. Servers bar, Messages content)
```
